## 🔎 Problem Statement

Traditional civic issue reporting systems face significant challenges in accessibility, transparency, and efficiency. Citizens, especially those in rural areas or with limited literacy, struggle to report infrastructure problems like potholes, broken streetlights, and sanitation issues through complex bureaucratic channels. The lack of real-time tracking and feedback creates distrust, while authorities face difficulties in prioritizing urgent issues and allocating resources effectively, leading to delayed resolutions and deteriorating civic infrastructure.
## 💡 Our Solution

**Assist Now** is an inclusive, AI-powered civic engagement platform that simplifies issue reporting through:

- **One-Touch Reporting:** Citizens instantly report problems using smartphone cameras with automatic location detection and photo verification
- **Inclusive Design:** Voice input and local language support ensure accessibility for illiterate and rural citizens
- **Smart Automation:** AI-powered categorization automatically routes issues to appropriate departments (PWD, Sanitation, Utilities) based on issue type and severity
- **Transparent Tracking:** Real-time status updates and notifications keep citizens informed from submission to resolution
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Administrative dashboard with analytics for identifying issue hotspots, tracking department performance, and optimizing resource allocation

The platform bridges the gap between citizens and authorities, fostering accountability, faster resolutions, and building trust through visible action and transparent governance.
